## Task 1: Analyzing Sentiment in Financial News Headlines

### Objective

The aim of this task is to explore how the sentiment of news headlines about stocks influences their prices. Specifically, I seek to determine if positive news leads to higher stock prices and if negative news results in price declines.

### How I Did It

1. **Data Reading:**
   I loaded a dataset containing financial news headlines and their publication dates to analyze the relationship between news sentiment and stock prices.

2. **Sentiment Analysis:**
   I used a sentiment analysis tool to score each headline's sentiment, ranging from very negative to very positive. This score helps in understanding the overall tone of the news and its potential impact on stock prices.

3. **Percentage Calculation:**
   I calculated the percentage of headlines falling into each sentiment category (very negative, negative, neutral, positive) relative to the total number of headlines for each publisher. This analysis helps in understanding how different publishers contribute to the overall sentiment.

### What I Found

The preliminary analysis suggests a general correlation between sentiment scores and stock prices. Positive sentiment is often associated with stock price increases, while negative sentiment aligns with declines. The time series decomposition provided insights into patterns in headline frequency, including trends and seasonal effects. Calculating sentiment percentages offers a view of how different publishers impact the sentiment landscape.
